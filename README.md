# My-projects
My school and personal project.

During my studies in Ecole Centrale de Lyon, a French engineer school (master degree), I did a lot of works and projects.
Many of these files are coded in French.

## First year

- Bibliotheque.py : I learned the basis of object-oriented programming with the management of a library.
- Pendu.py : Going deeper in object-oriented programming because I had to handle Tkinter object and programming a game with it
- Segmentation.py : algorithmic work, it is image segmentation
- Rendu_monnaie.py : algorithmic work, program that compute how does a machine give change with dynamic programming

## Second year

- parcours_cavalier.py : Coding the knight's tour probleme where a chess knight needs to travel all the chessboard by going a case one time only
- morpion.py : Tic-tac-toe game, there are some AI work on it (minmax, best first, alpha beta (I didn't do the last one))
- colonie_de_fourmi.py : Ant colony optimization algorithms to find the shortest way on a graph. There is a part of genetic algorihtme. It didn't work well, comment the line 69 to stop the genetic part
- neural_network.ipynb : ipython notebook on how does a basic neural network works, simple digit identification
- Chaos file : 4 exercices on the chaos. Contain four ipython notebook of Newton Fractal, Lorenz system, Rössler attractorand Sierpiński triangle

## Personnal works

- snake.py : Using tkinter to code the snake game. It's the game for a futur reiforced learning algorithm which will create an AI who will won this game.
